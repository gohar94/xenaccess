This code is designed to allow volatility to work on live Xen domains, using
XenAccess.  Volatility is a volatile memory analysis tool with all kinds of
useful features for extracting higher level memory features from Windows and,
to a lesser extent, Linux memory images.  XenAccess provides an abstraction
of a memory image for each virtual machine.  So this code serves as an
adapter between the two libraries.
