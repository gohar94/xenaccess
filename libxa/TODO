# ToDo Items
* update code to not use deprecated functions anywhere, and then go ahead
  and remove those functions
* setup cache for most recently mapped pages to prevent thrashing by people
  using the convience functions
* finish using cr3 instead of kpgd throughout, or come up with a way to 
  reliably find the kpgd value
  - need to make sure this works with both live VMs and memory files
* fix double lookup when xa_access_kernel_symbol
* cache pid to pgd mappings 
* add default ntoskrnl_base values to be searched first
* add / fix / update documentation as needed
  - move description of codebase out of xenaccess.h


## Future Plans
* cleanup code throughout and fix TODO spots
* create higher level abstractions
  -- iterators (process lists, module lists, other lists)
  -- windows handle table walking
  -- windows VADs
  -- linux proc data (?)
  -- windows registry data (?)
* consider adding data gathering from xenbus, xenoprofile, etc
* create some kind of clean api abtraction for memory that spans multiple pages
* show additional example applications
* add function that returns active domid(s)
* add init function that works based on domain name instead of id
* autodetect os type
* automatically determine offset information
