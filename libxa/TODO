Here's a list of things that I'd like to do in the future with this code.  This
list is in no particular order...

* cleanup code throughout and fix TODO spots
* create higher level abstractions
* consider adding data gathering from xenbus, xenoprofile, etc
* create some kind of clean api abtraction for memory that spans multiple pages
* show additional example applications
* add function that returns active domid(s)


# Windows Support

## xa_core.c
* set_os_type() should actually determine OS
  -- auto detect would be ideal
  -- but perhaps hard code into config file for now?
* symbol to address mappings
  -- ntoskrnl.dll in memory has an export table that provides some mappings 
  -- also consider symbolic information used by debugger tools
  -- "dumpbin ntoskrnl.exe /exports"  RVA --> symbol
* location to page global directory (same as swapper_pg_dir)
  -- store in instance->kpgd()
* init_task??
  -- used only when looking for a specific process in memory
  -- need to figure out how windows stores task information

## all files
* refactor code to pull architecture-specific memory code out of the linux
  part of the libraries and into a general section
  -- assumption is that xenaccess will only support x86 for now
