XenAccess v0.5 README
by Bryan D. Payne
=====================

This file contains very basic instructions to get you up and running.  If you
want more details about installation, or programming with XenAccess, then see
the documentation included in the doc/ subdirectory of XenAccess, or view the
documentation online at http://doc.xenaccess.org.

Dependencies
------------
The following libraries are used in building this code:

libxc (from Xen, the Xen Control library)
libxenstore (from Xen, access to the xenstore)
yacc OR bison (for reading the configuration file)
lex OR flex (for reading the configuration file)

Building
--------
XenAccess uses the standard GNU build system.  To compile this library, simply
follow the steps below:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

Note that if you only want to use XenAccess to read dd-style memory files,
then you can pass the "--disable-xen" option to configure.  This will build
XenAccess without any Xen support, allowing you to use the library on systems
without Xen installed.

The example code will work without installing XenAccess.  However, you may
choose to install the library into the prefix specified to 'configure' by:

make install

The default installation prefix is /usr/local.


Want to Help?
-------------
One of the motivations for starting this project was to create a place where
everyone interested in using introspection could come together and share
ideas.  Introspection has many potential uses and it doesn't make sense for
everyone to keep rewriting code to do this.  Instead, let's use XenAccess as
a common base and spend our time exploring all of the interesting things that
introspection can be used for.  

If you'd like to add features to the code, please drop me a line on the
mailing list.  I'm always happy to take new ideas, code patches, and even
add developers to the group, depending on how you would like to get invovled.
