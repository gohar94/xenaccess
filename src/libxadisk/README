libxadisk README file
=====================

This is a prototype version of the XenAccess disk monitor, which will 
soon be integrated with the memory introspection code. Please keep in 
mind that this preliminary code, meaning it has some limitations and 
needs considerable work/cleanup.

File contents:

xadisk.h - Future library API, to be included by monitoring applications
xadisk_core.c - Implements the core monitoring functions
xadisk_global.h - Global definitions
xadisk_hash.h - Definitions for hash table manipulation functions
xadisk_hash.c - Implementation for hash table manipulation functions
xadisk_linux_ext2.c - Functions for parsing EXT2 FS structures
xadisk_parse.h - Definition of high-level parsing functions
xadisk_parse.c - Implementation of high-level parsing functions

COMPILATION:

Simply execute ./make.sh

The files inside the xen/ directory must also be copied to their appropriate 
location inside the Xen source tree: tools/blktap/drivers/ and the tools package 
must be recompiled (make tools; make install-tools).

Wrapper drivers "log-sync" or "log-aio" must be used in the domain configuration 
file in place of the standard drivers.

RUNNING THE MONITORING EXAMPLE:

export LD_PRELOAD=./libxadisk.so
./monitor <DOMU_DIR>
