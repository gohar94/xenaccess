The files in this directory show some ways that you can use XenAccess.
To compile the examples simply type 'make'.  To run the examples, choose
the example you want to run and use the run script:

  e.g.,
    ./run ./module-list

module-list.c -- lists the LKMs installed in another domain by walking
     through the module list in the domain's kernel memory
