Here's a list of things that I'd like to do in the future with this code.  This
list is in no particular order...

* cleanup code throughout and fix TODO spots
* create higher level abstractions
* consider adding data gathering from xenbus, xenoprofile, etc
* create some kind of clean api abtraction for memory that spans multiple pages
* show additional example applications
* add function that returns active domid(s)
