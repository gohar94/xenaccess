#summary Working configuration file entries.

= Introduction =

This page lists entries from `xenaccess.conf` that are known to be working.  You can use these to create a working configuration file for your system when you are getting started with !XenAccess.  If you have any working entries that are not shown here, feel free to add them.

Note that the sysmap value in each entry should be omitted because this is a path and file name that will change for each installation of !XenAccess.
