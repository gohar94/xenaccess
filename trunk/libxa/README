Disclaimer
----------
This code is still very young.  The API is subject to change often.  The code may
crash and do other bad things.  So, have fun, play around, but don't expect clean
polished code just yet :-)


Dependencies
------------
The following libraries are used in building this code:

libxc (from Xen, the Xen Control library)
libvirt (see http://libvirt.org)
libxml2 (see http://xmlsoft.org)
  -- note that libxml2 is part of many distributions already
  -- on fedora the package name is libxml2 and libxml2-devel


Building and Using
------------------
Right now, just type 'make'.  There's no 'make install' yet.  There's no
'./configure' yet.  Those will come in time.  If you'd like to use things
right away, you can manually install the library or use LD_PRELOAD to
load the library in place.  For example:

[root@xenmaster examples]# ./module-list 
./module-list: error while loading shared libraries: libxenaccess.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[root@xenmaster examples]# export LD_PRELOAD=/<path to XenAccess library>/libxenaccess.so
[root@xenmaster examples]# ./module-list 
ipv6
autofs4
af_packet
binfmt_misc
md
unix
dm_snapshot
dm_zero
dm_mirror
ext3
jbd
dm_mod
[root@xenmaster examples]# 


Want to Help?
-------------
One of the motivations for starting this project was to create a place where everyone
interested in using introspection could come together and share ideas.  Introspection
has many potential uses and it doesn't make sense for everyone to keep rewriting 
code to do this.  Instead, let's use XenAccess as a common base and spend our time
exploring all of the interesting things that introspection can be used for.

If you'd like to add features to the code, please drop me a line on the mailing list.
I'm always happy to take new ideas, code patches, and even add developers to the group,
depending on how you would like to get invovled.
