Here's a list of things that I'd like to do in the future with this code.  This
list is in no particular order...

* switch over build system to use standard build tools (autoconf et al)
* cleanup code throughout and fix TODO spots
* create higher level abstractions
* consider adding data gathering from xenbus, xenoprofile, etc
* create some kind of clean api abtraction for memory that spans multiple pages
* show additional example applications
* add function that returns active domid(s)
* get page global directory via control register in CPU instead of 
  using os-specific symbol information ??

========================================================
Items needed before 0.3 release
* configure file for reading system map file location for target domain
* check that 'make install' has desired effect
* does configure check for xenctrl and xenstore library?
* get ID / Date auto filled for each source file
* update AUTHORS file with new files
