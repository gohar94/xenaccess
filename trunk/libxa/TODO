# ToDo Items
* add / fix / update documentation as needed
  - move description of codebase out of xenaccess.h
* create tools directory with...
  - 64-bit patch
  - linux offset finder tool
* update config reader to accept linux_name parameter


## Future Plans
* cleanup code throughout and fix TODO spots
* create higher level abstractions
  -- iterators (process lists, module lists, other lists)
  -- windows handle table walking
  -- windows VADs
  -- linux proc data (?)
  -- windows registry data (?)
* consider adding data gathering from xenbus, xenoprofile, etc
* create some kind of clean api abtraction for memory that spans multiple pages
* show additional example applications
* add function that returns active domid(s)
* autodetect os type
* automatically determine offset information
* setup cache for most recently mapped pages to prevent thrashing by people
  using the convience functions
  -- This may not be able to be done inside XA because XA can't know when
     memory pages are still in use by the user of the library.  Would need
     to somehow handle mappings done by the library differently than 
     mappings done by the user of the library.
* finish using cr3 instead of kpgd throughout, or come up with a way to 
  reliably find the kpgd value
  - need to make sure this works with both live VMs and memory files
* tool for automatically finding windows offsets
